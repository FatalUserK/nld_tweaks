install instructions for dumbfucks who dont know how to use GitHub:

Install GitHub desktop from here: https://desktop.github.com/download/
Click the big "Code" button at the top of this repository page
Click "Open with GitHub Desktop" (and allow it to do so if it asks)
Install to `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Noita/mods/nld_tweaks` where "Noita" should be the folder that contains your noita.exe file
Ensure the structure is something like `mods/nld_tweaks/init.lua` (should not be nested!!)

Now to update whenever, you just open GitHub Desktop, and if the top right button says "Fetch origin", clicking it will have it check if there's an update
If there is an update it will change to say "Pull origin", click that to update the mod
